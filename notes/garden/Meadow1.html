    <h1>learning how to make a meadow part 1</h1>
<p>This is course notes from the NDAL Making a meadow session.</p>
<p>Planning and maintenance is constant, Meadows are constantly changing and will shift over time. It can be hard to keep a desired effect without intentional management</p>
<p>Meadow in a can - silly old product from the 60s that was an early attempt at meadow building and lawn alternatives
failed because it was very quick growing and not particularly hardy or reliable plants
out competed, not reseeding or spreading.</p>
<p>Some plants like annuals can be thought of early succession planting, they are not long lived and shoot up strongly. Spread along disturbances then lose out to the more persistent slower growing plants. Life span etc plays into it.</p>
<p>Short lived plants can remain in the system via seed for a long time.</p>
<p>Gallardia - gets pushed out my perennials but does well in open reseeded areas, tougher locations, disturbance etc. Hills in texas, roof top gardens</p>
<p>Meadow and Prairie are quite interchangable. There isnt clear differences, same as savanah(includes scattered trees tho), grasslands etc.</p>
<p>Resources:
understand the meadow - prairie plants and their environment
import to understanding how prairies and meadows exist by looking at midwest as an example
<strong>Native grasses tend to have incredibly dense root systems, lots of root death and new growth, constantly injecting organic matter into the soil</strong>
Important component of landscape and are the driver of soil development for the forbs.
Gentian - specialist species, the prairie example here had gentian appear like 15+ years down the road. Disturbed soil and long lived seeds. Grasses in the meadow brought the soil back to life and the seeds embedded germinated after soil was corrected.</p>
<p>Fieldguides - fine for basic info on the plants and prairie
handbooks on plant pairings, localized guides all handy tools
a lot of the issue is we didnt know what the grasslands were like since it was lost so quickly
ending native burn practices destroyed a lot of the easts grasslands</p>
<p>currently dominated by plants designed for european agriculture, grazing grasses and grains
Important distinction between native meadow and just a meadow</p>
<p>Botanical Floras books to just learn about the plants for your immediate area.</p>
<p>BONAPs taxo information USA only</p>
<h3 id="design-principals-">Design Principal - Plant Selection Criteria</h3>
<h4 id="plant-community-model">Plant Community Model</h4>
<p>Where am I ecologically speaking, what is my area classified as, what ecoregion. 
These are the plants happy with your soil, moisture, temps
Find the resources for your area</p>
<p>Priorities - Weed suppression vs Species Diversity
More native not a lot of invasive you can focus on the plants instead of weed suppression
more disturbance usually the more invasive plants
In heavily invasive areas you use the most aggressive native plant to rehabilitiate.
If the area has a lot of native plants focus on preserving them and avoid high aggression species.
low weed pressure
This drives your plant choices and stategy
some places you just need the high aggression basic plants to fight weed pressure. Eventually things can be adjusted as the weed issues become less important
ability to do maintenance also factors into how big of an issue weed pressure is.
Can mix and match, focused diversity areas, and broader weed suppression.</p>
<p>Competition and the importance of habitat fidelity
Closest to the condition the plant naturally occurs in. There is a difference between a garden and meadow. The plants will compete. 
Match plant to conditions, dont match soil to everything.</p>
<p>Poor soils do not require amendment, they require a plant that naturally occurs there</p>
<p>Water table wet vs poor draining soil for a reason a meadow is wet</p>
<p>Soil Type:
Sand, Loam, Clay
need to actually test to find this, broad strokes can usually be applied here
handful of tests around this</p>
<p>Soil Moistures:
Xeric - dry
Mesic - middle
Hydric - wet
    Obligate - always has to be wet
    Facultative - can handle some drying and flooding</p>
<p>Sub areas within each grouping, 
can also have different moistures within the same meadow</p>
<p>Light:
Edge meadows, hills get less light than open meadow. Totally different plants within that micro habitat</p>
<h4 id="plant-community-design-">Plant Community Design:</h4>
<p>Need to choose plants that coevolved with each other and do not compete
Mixing textures and heights, different root structures, dense, intermingled, plants agreeing to their niche and being weed suppressive and stable together. The pairing will cover the entire range within the same confined space.
Niches around time, seasonal competition, ephemerals etc
Coefficients of conservatism is a measure of how conservative a plant is vs being a generalist</p>
<ul>
<li>look at to help understand communities</li>
<li>states how specific a plant is vs generalist, use as a tool based on your site conditions</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="include-multiple-phases-of-compositional-change">Include multiple phases of compositional change</h4>
<p>Succession plans
things that boom at the start then get out competed down the road as the environment changes
shortlived mixed in with long lived
The meadow will constantly change, yearly weather will affect the next years growth.</p>
<p>Plan around the Niches that exist, see Meadows Niche organization chart</p>
<p>Make your list and organise according to the chart.
(need to revisit my spreadsheets, or individual plant notes and make fully query-able)</p>
<h4 id="seed-mix-formulation-steps-">Seed mix formulation steps:</h4>
<p>See PP</p>
<p>80-100 seeds per square foot is good baseline</p>
<p>assign percentages based off species, then you order based on that
Nurse crop, planted half the rate so it doesnt prevent seedling germination</p>
<h4 id="historic-vs-novel-plant-communities-">Historic vs Novel Plant communities:</h4>
<p>eurasian are mat forming, shallow roots, cool season grasses
warm season grasses are clump forming and deeper roots.</p>
<p>Need to get rid of both those grasses when working an area as they define the community
its why invasive flowers spread so well with their grasses
Cant seed turf grass, but can put in live plants...</p>
<p>replace a whole community with the desired one.
Coefficients of conservatism can be used, dont focus on conservative species in disturbance
look at root structures and growth periods. Fill a complementary niche
Bulbs vs taproot, taproot doesnt compete on the surface of turf</p>
<p>Need to actually just look at the plants, understand what they are doing</p>
<p>go back to the 30s for research of your area...</p>
<p>Orchard has different disturbance than a plowed farm or grazed lot.
Dont be the first one to disturb something. Light hand on undisturbed areas, protect vs suppress</p>
<p>The Bower - can get tours <a href="https://thegardenbower.com/">https://thegardenbower.com/</a> was used as one of his examples</p>
<h4 id="weeds-question">Weeds question</h4>
<p>Disturbed bare soil of questionable source
throw native aggressive grass to germinate with weeds and let it grow
want a whole variety of conditions to get the weeds to germinate so you can exhaust the seed load. Dont plant good stuff yet, you will kill them dealing with weeds. Exhaust the weeds then plant your targets.</p>
<p>Weeds are the biggest hurdle in Meadows.</p>
<p>Important Notes:
<strong>Native grasses tend to have incredibly dense root systems, lots of root death and new growth, constantly injecting organic matter into the soil</strong></p>
<p>Notes to me:
cardinal flower is not competitive or long lived</p>
